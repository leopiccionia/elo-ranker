# Elo ranker

This project helps you set up a local image ranking based on [Elo rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

It requires uploading a seed file; for example, look at [this demo file](demos/estados-br.ini). The scores are persisted on local storage, so rankings can be resumed.
